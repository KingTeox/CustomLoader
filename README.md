# Nodemon
Either through cloning with git or by using npm (the recommended way):

>npm install -g nodemon # or using yarn: yarn global add nodemon

*And nodemon will be installed globally to your system path.*

You can also install nodemon as a development dependency:

>npm install --save-dev nodemon # or using yarn: yarn add nodemon -D

*With a local installation, nodemon will not be available in your system path or you can't use it directly from the command line. Instead, the local installation of nodemon can be run by calling it from within an npm script (such as npm start) or using npx nodemon.*

Install by https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon
